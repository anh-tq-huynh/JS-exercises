## Key Learnings & Skills Developed

Across these modules, I've gained practical experience and strengthened my skills in a comprehensive range of **frontend** and **fundamental programming concepts**:

### Core Programming & JavaScript Fundamentals

* **Basic Input/Output (I/O):** Proficiently using `prompt()` for user input, `console.log()` for debugging and output, and `alert()`/`confirm()` for user interaction.
* **Data Types & Type Conversion:** Handling diverse data types, with a focus on explicit type conversion.
* **Arithmetic & Math Operations:** Implementing calculations like sums, products, averages, square roots (`Math.sqrt()`), and complex probability calculations.
* **Random Number Generation:** Utilizing `Math.random()` to generate random values for simulations (dice rolls, random assignments).
* **Control Flow:** Mastering **conditional statements** (`if`/`else if`/`else`, `switch`) for decision-making and **loops** (`for`) for iterative tasks, including nested structures for array processing and simulations.
* **Error Handling (Basic):** Implementing checks for invalid input (e.g., negative numbers for square roots) and handling missing data (e.g., optional chaining, ternary operators for image fallbacks).
* **Problem-Solving & Algorithm Design:** Developing logical solutions for diverse computational problems, including determining leap years, identifying prime numbers, simulating probabilistic outcomes, and managing data collections.

### Data Structures & Functions

* **Arrays:** Creating, manipulating, and iterating through arrays, and sorting (alphabetical, numerical) without built-in methods.
* **Functions:** Defining and using functions with parameters and return values to encapsulate reusable logic (e.g., dice rolls, array concatenation, even number filtering).
* **Objects:** Storing and managing structured data using JavaScript objects, particularly in array collections.
* **Sorting Algorithms:** Implementing custom comparison logic for sorting arrays of objects.

### Web Development & DOM Manipulation (Frontend)

* **HTML Fundamentals:** Structuring web pages using HTML5 elements.
* **CSS Fundamentals:** Styling web content and layouts with CSS3 for aesthetics and responsiveness.
* **DOM Manipulation:**
    * **Adding/Modifying Content:** Dynamically injecting HTML content using `innerHTML` and creating/appending elements using `createElement()` and `appendChild()`.
    * **Attribute Manipulation:** Setting and getting element attributes (e.g., `src`, `alt`, `target`).
    * **Class Manipulation:** Adding and removing CSS classes to elements.
* **Events:** Implementing interactive elements using **event listeners** (e.g., `click`) to trigger JavaScript functions.
* **Form Handling:** Reading input from form fields and preventing default form submission behavior.
* **Modular UI Components:** Building complex UI elements like dynamically populated product catalogs, articles, and select options.
* **Modal Dialogs:** Implementing interactive pop-up windows using `<dialog>` elements with `showModal()` and `close()` functions for enhanced user experience.

### Asynchronous JavaScript & API Integration (AJAX)

* **Fetch API:** Making asynchronous HTTP requests to external APIs (`TVMaze API`, `Chuck Norris API`) to retrieve data.
* **JSON Handling:** Processing and parsing JSON data received from APIs.
* **Dynamic Content Loading:** Displaying fetched data dynamically on the web page, including images, links, and text summaries.
* **Error Handling (API):** Implementing robust logic for handling missing data from API responses (e.g., optional chaining, ternary operators for default images).
* **Search Functionality:** Building interactive search forms that query APIs based on user input.
